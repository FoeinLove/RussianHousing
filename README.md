## Analysis Guidelines

Data is in data/raw folder.
If you need to save modified data files, save them under data/interim or data/processed.

Data dictionary, samples and other stuff are in references.
Use the notebooks folder for Jupyter notebooks. Don't collaborate on notebooks on git (json with binary blobs are hard to git diff),
instead use notebooks for exploratory analysis, visualization, creating outputs, etc. Save actual processing scripts under src.
